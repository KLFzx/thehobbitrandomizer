# thehobbitrandomizer
Randomizer mod for The Hobbit 2003

-------------------------------------------
If your game is not C://Games//Hobbit or D://Hobbit ( smth like that ) undfs.exe might not have rights to write and you wont be able to take snapshot of all levels.

All the files should be gathered in a folder called 'random' and the nextracted to the main game root folder. 
Then you can simply create shortcut for the .exe file to your desktop to quickly run the program.

Exporttool, dfs packer and unpacker were taken from Modera:
